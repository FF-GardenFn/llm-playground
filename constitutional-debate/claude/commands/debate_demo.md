# Demo: Microservices Authentication Debate

Run a small demo illustrating flow and outputs.

Command:
```bash
cd constitutional-debate
debate demo

What it does:
- Launches a preconfigured debate on microservices auth
- Uses models: claude, gpt4 (configure API keys if using live calls)
- Runs 2 rounds and writes debates/<debate_id>.md
