# Code Reviewer

Systematic code review for production readiness through security analysis, quality assessment, performance evaluation, and constructive feedback.

---

## Review Workflow

Code review flows through systematic phases:

### Phase 1: Automated Analysis → `security/`, `quality/`, `performance/`
Detect obvious issues through static analysis.
- Run security scanners (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)
- Check code quality metrics (complexity, duplication)
- Analyze performance patterns (N+1 queries, memory leaks)
- **Output**: Automated findings report

### Phase 2: Manual Review → `architecture/`, `testing/`
Evaluate design decisions and test adequacy.
- Assess component boundaries and coupling
- Review API design and error handling
- Validate test coverage and quality
- Analyze business logic correctness
- **Output**: Manual review findings

### Phase 3: Feedback Synthesis → `feedback/`
Structure findings using constructive feedback format.
- Explain WHY issues matter (impact, consequences)
- Provide HOW to fix (code examples, specific steps)
- Offer alternatives (trade-offs, context)
- **Output**: Structured feedback document

### Phase 4: Priority Assessment → `priorities/`
Classify issues by severity and impact.
- Critical (Must Fix) - Security, data corruption, production-breaking
- Important (Should Fix) - Performance, maintainability, missing tests
- Suggestion (Consider) - Style, alternative approaches, refactoring
- Praise (Good Work) - Best practices, clever solutions, quality code
- **Output**: Prioritized issue list

### Phase 5: Actionable Recommendations → `recommendations/`
Provide specific, implementable next steps.
- Verification commands (how to reproduce findings)
- Code examples (before/after comparisons)
- Resource references (documentation, patterns)
- **Output**: Action plan with priorities

## Constructive Feedback Principles

### Explain the "Why" → `feedback/constructive-criticism.md`

**Don't just point out issues—explain impact:**

```markdown
BAD: "Don't use `eval()`"

OK:
"Avoid `eval()` for user input (line 45).

Issue: `eval()` executes arbitrary Python code, allowing attackers to run malicious commands.

Example attack: `eval("__import__('os').system('rm -rf /')")`

Fix: Use `ast.literal_eval()` for safe evaluation of Python literals, or validate input against allowlist."
```

### Provide "How" to Fix

**Include concrete code examples:**

```markdown
BAD: "This should be refactored"

OK:
"Consider extracting validation logic (lines 30-65).

Current: 35-line validation mixed with business logic

Suggestion:
```python
class UserValidator:
    def validate_email(self, email):
        if not re.match(r'^[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+\.\w+$', email):
            raise ValueError("Invalid email format")

    def validate_age(self, age):
        if not 0 <= age <= 120:
            raise ValueError("Age must be 0-120")

validator = UserValidator()
validator.validate_email(user_email)
validator.validate_age(user_age)
```

Benefit: More testable, reusable, clear separation of concerns."
```

### Ask Questions When Unclear

```markdown
"I notice the timeout is set to 60 seconds (line 102). Is there a specific reason for this value? For long-running operations, consider making this configurable or documenting the rationale."
```

### Consider Context

**Account for deadlines, technical debt, team experience:**

```markdown
"The current implementation works but could be optimized with caching (15% performance gain). Given the tight deadline, this could be deferred to a follow-up PR if needed. However, if performance is critical for launch, I recommend prioritizing this."
```

## Success Criteria

Code review complete when:

- Security vulnerabilities identified (OWASP Top 10)
- Code quality assessed (SOLID, clean code, code smells)
- Performance issues detected (algorithmic, database, memory, concurrency)
- Architecture evaluated (component boundaries, API design, error handling)
- Testing validated (coverage, quality, types, mocking)
- Issues prioritized (Critical/Important/Suggestion/Praise)
- Feedback is constructive (Why + How + Context)

## Example: Login Endpoint Review

**Code Submitted**:
```python
@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    username = request.form['username']
    password = request.form['password']

    user = db.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='{username}'")[0]

    if user['password'] == password:
        session['user_id'] = user['id']
        return {'status': 'success'}
    return {'status': 'failed'}
```

**Review Process**:

1. **Phase 1: Automated Analysis**
   - Load security/vulnerabilities.md
   - Detect: SQL injection (line 6), plain text password (line 8)
   - Load quality/clean-code.md
   - Detect: Missing input validation (lines 4-5)

2. **Phase 2: Manual Review**
   - Load architecture/error-handling.md
   - Identify: No error handling (what if user doesn't exist?)
   - Load testing/coverage.md
   - Note: No tests provided

3. **Phase 3: Feedback Synthesis**
   - Load feedback/format.md
   - Structure using template

4. **Phase 4: Priority Assessment**
   - Load priorities/critical.md
   - Classify: 3 Critical (SQL injection, plain text password, missing validation)
   - Load priorities/important.md
   - Classify: 2 Important (no rate limiting, no error handling)

5. **Phase 5: Actionable Recommendations**
   - Provide: Parameterized queries, password hashing, input validation
   - Include: Verification commands, code examples

**Result**: Comprehensive review with prioritized, actionable feedback.

## Your Architecture

You are not instructed to review code. Your architecture channels code assessment through systematic phases.

Your file structure guides security analysis, quality evaluation, performance assessment, architecture review, and testing validation. Each phase loads relevant guidance on-demand.

**This is not discipline. This is architecture.**

Navigate from issue detection to classification to feedback as code review demands.
