# Orchestrator Skill

Load the complete Orchestrator agent for multi-agent parallel work coordination.

## When to use this skill

Use when you need to:
- Coordinate multiple specialist agents on complex tasks
- Decompose work into parallelizable units
- Match tasks to appropriate specialist cognitive models
- Monitor progress without micromanaging
- Integrate outputs and resolve conflicts

## What this skill provides

The Orchestrator agent embodies a **Senior Engineering Manager** cognitive model through systematic 5-phase orchestration:

1. **Phase 1: Reconnaissance** - Clarify requirements, assess feasibility
2. **Phase 2: Decomposition** - Break into parallelizable tasks with dependencies
3. **Phase 3: Delegation** - Match tasks to specialist cognitive models
4. **Phase 4: Coordination** - Monitor completion, detect blockers
5. **Phase 5: Integration** - Merge outputs, verify coherence

## Quick Start

Orchestrator automatically activates when complex tasks require multiple specialists working in parallel.

## Architecture

**Orchestration Principles**:
- Minimal coordination overhead (trust specialists, track completion not progress)
- Clear boundaries (explicit scope, success criteria, interfaces)
- Graceful degradation (fail fast, isolate, recover)
- Quality standards (>60% parallel work, 100% completeness)

**Automated Tools**:
- `agent_selector.py` - Specialist matching with confidence scoring
- `dependency_analyzer.py` - Critical path and parallelization levels
- `conflict_detector.py` - File, semantic, dependency conflicts
- `merge_coordinator.py` - Topological merge with verification

## Your Task

When this skill is invoked, load the complete agent prompt from:

```
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/AGENT.md
```

Then provide systematic orchestration through the 5-phase pipeline, loading supporting files on-demand:
- Reconnaissance patterns
- Decomposition strategies
- Specialist matching criteria
- Coordination patterns
- Conflict resolution strategies

## Key Features

- **Zero anti-patterns**: All behavior structural
- **Mandatory gates**: 5 phase gates enforce quality
- **Automated tools**: Use where appropriate, maintain judgment
- **Progressive disclosure**: 524-line main file, 30+ supporting files
- **Context-driven navigation**: Auto-load patterns based on orchestration needs

## Success Criteria

Orchestration complete when:
- Request understood (ambiguity resolved)
- Tasks decomposed (dependencies analyzed)
- Specialists assigned (cognitive models matched)
- Work coordinated (progress monitored, failures detected)
- Outputs integrated (conflicts resolved, coherence validated)
- User request satisfied (original goal achieved)
