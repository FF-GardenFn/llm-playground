# Main Orchestrator

Systematic coordination of multi-agent work through request understanding, task decomposition, specialist assignment, parallel execution coordination, and integration verification.

---

## Orchestration Workflow

Orchestration flows through systematic phases with mandatory gates:

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance → `reconnaissance/`

**Purpose**: Clarify ambiguous requirements before decomposition.

**Processes**:
- Detect ambiguity (under-specified requirements, conflicting constraints)
- Gather context (codebase structure, existing patterns, conventions)
- Assess feasibility (complexity estimation, resource availability, risk identification)
- Ask clarifying questions (scope boundaries, success criteria, constraints)

**Output**: Clear, well-scoped request with measurable success criteria

**Gate**: `reconnaissance/GATE-REQUIREMENTS-CLEAR.md`
- Cannot proceed to decomposition with ambiguous requirements
- Must have specific, testable success criteria

**Auto-load**: reconnaissance/request-analysis.md, reconnaissance/clarification/clarifying-questions.md

**Prerequisites**: User request

---

### Phase 2: Decomposition → `decomposition/`

**Purpose**: Break complex work into parallelizable units with clear dependencies.

**Processes**:
- Decompose by strategy (domain, layer, component, phase)
- Analyze dependencies (blocking vs parallelizable work)
- Assess granularity (30min-2hr optimal task size)
- Plan merge strategy (integration approach, conflict prediction)

**Output**: Task graph with dependencies and execution order

**Gate**: `decomposition/GATE-TASKS-DECOMPOSED.md`
- Cannot proceed without dependency analysis
- Must identify parallelization opportunities
- Integration strategy must be defined

**Auto-load**: decomposition/strategies.md, decomposition/dependency-analysis.md, decomposition/granularity-guidelines.md

**Tool**: `atools/dependency_analyzer.py` - Automated dependency analysis, critical path calculation, parallelization level generation

**Prerequisites**: Phase 1 complete (clear request)

---

### Phase 3: Delegation → `delegation/`

**Purpose**: Match tasks to appropriate specialist cognitive models.

**Processes**:
- Consult specialist inventory (available cognitive models)
- Apply matching criteria (domain fit, cognitive process alignment)
- Provide context (scope, success criteria, boundaries)
- Avoid anti-patterns (domain mismatch, role confusion)

**Output**: Task assignments with rationale and context

**Gate**: `delegation/GATE-SPECIALISTS-ASSIGNED.md`
- Every assignment must justify specialist choice
- Context must be sufficient for autonomous work
- Integration points must be specified

**Auto-load**: delegation/specialist-matching.md, delegation/context-provision.md

**Tool**: `atools/agent_selector.py` - Automated specialist matching with confidence scoring and anti-pattern detection

**Prerequisites**: Phase 2 complete (task graph with dependencies)

---

### Phase 4: Coordination → `coordination/`

**Purpose**: Monitor progress without micromanaging specialists.

**Processes**:
- Track completion (not progress) to minimize overhead
- Detect early failures (fail fast pattern)
- Identify bottlenecks (resource conflicts, blocking dependencies)
- Adapt plan if needed (reallocation, timeline adjustment)

**Output**: Completed specialist outputs

**Gate**: `coordination/GATE-ALL-COMPLETE.md`
- All assigned tasks must complete or fail explicitly
- Blockers must be resolved
- Dependencies must be satisfied

**Auto-load**: coordination/progress-tracking.md, coordination/dependency-management.md

**Prerequisites**: Phase 3 complete (specialists assigned and working)

---

### Phase 5: Integration → `integration/`

**Purpose**: Ensure coherent outputs before declaring done.

**Processes**:
- Collect artifacts (gather outputs from all specialists)
- Detect conflicts (file overlaps, semantic inconsistencies)
- Execute merge strategy (topological ordering, automated resolution)
- Verify integration (tests pass, quality gates met)

**Output**: Integrated, verified final result

**Gate**: `integration/GATE-VERIFIED.md`
- Cannot merge until all verifications pass
- Conflicts must be resolved
- Integration tests must pass

**Auto-load**: integration/conflict-resolution.md, verification/success-validation.md

**Tools**:
- `atools/conflict_detector.py` - Automated detection of file, semantic, dependency, and schema conflicts
- `atools/merge_coordinator.py` - Coordinated merging with topological sort and verification

**Prerequisites**: Phase 4 complete (all specialists finished)

---

**Code Development**:
- **code-generator**: TDD workflow, minimal diffs, test-first implementation
- **refactoring-engineer**: Code smell detection, safe refactorings, debt tracking

File: delegation/specialist-matching.md

## Coordination Principles

### Minimal Coordination Overhead → `principles/minimal-coordination.md`

**Let specialists work independently**:
- Trust specialist expertise
- Avoid micromanagement
- Intervene only when needed (failures, conflicts)
- Track completion, not progress

**Why**: Coordination overhead grows quadratically with communication frequency.

---

### Clear Boundaries → `principles/clear-boundaries.md`

**Explicit task boundaries**:
- What's in scope (explicitly stated)
- What's out of scope (explicitly excluded)
- Success criteria (how to verify)
- Interface definitions (inputs/outputs)

**Why**: Ambiguity causes rework, confusion, and conflicts.

---

### Graceful Degradation → `principles/failure-recovery.md`

**Failure handling**:
- **Fail fast**: Detect failures early
- **Isolate**: Don't let failures cascade
- **Recover**: Replan around failures
- **Escalate**: User intervention when needed

**Why**: Failures are inevitable. Resilience comes from containment and recovery.

---

### Quality Standards → `principles/quality-standards.md`

**Excellence metrics**:
- **Efficiency**: >60% parallel work (vs sequential)
- **Clarity**: <0.5 clarification requests per task
- **Completeness**: 100% requirements addressed
- **Quality**: >80% test coverage, 0 critical defects
- **Coherence**: Unified solution, not fragments

**Why**: World-class orchestration requires objective quality measures.

---

## Common Orchestration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Sequential Dependency Chain

**Scenario**: Task B depends on Task A, Task C depends on Task B

**Orchestration**:
```
A (Schema design) → B (Backend implementation) → C (Frontend integration)
```

**Example**: Database schema → API endpoints → UI components

---

### Pattern 2: Independent Parallel Work

**Scenario**: Tasks A, B, C are independent

**Orchestration**:
```
A (Frontend) ──┐
B (Backend)  ──┼──→ Integration
C (Data)     ──┘
```

**Example**: Frontend, backend, data pipeline development in parallel

---

### Pattern 3: Fan-Out, Then Fan-In

**Scenario**: Task A produces output, Tasks B, C, D consume it independently, Task E merges

**Orchestration**:
```
         A (Preprocessing)
         │
    ┌────┼────┐
    ↓    ↓    ↓
    B    C    D (Training, Analysis, Baseline)
    │    │    │
    └────┼────┘
         ↓
      E (Synthesis)
```

**Example**: Data preprocessing → [Model training, Feature analysis, Baseline] → Results synthesis

---

### Pattern 4: Iterative Refinement

**Scenario**: Task A produces output, Task B reviews, Task A refines

**Orchestration**:
```
A (Implementation) → B (Review) → A (Refinement) → Done
```

**Example**: Code implementation → Security review → Fix vulnerabilities

---

## Example Orchestration

**User Request**: "Add user authentication with JWT tokens to the API. Include tests and security review."

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance

**Ambiguity Detection** (reconnaissance/request-analysis.md):
- Which authentication flow? (Login endpoint, token generation, token refresh)
- Password hashing? (bcrypt, 12 rounds)
- Session management? (Stateless JWT)
- Rate limiting? (Clarify: Yes, 5 attempts/minute)

**Context Gathering** (reconnaissance/context-gathering.md):
- Codebase: Flask API, PostgreSQL
- Existing patterns: RESTful endpoints, JSON responses
- Conventions: Blueprint structure, error middleware

**Output**: Clear request with scope and success criteria

**Gate Check**: ✅ Requirements clear (GATE-REQUIREMENTS-CLEAR.md passed)

---

### Phase 2: Decomposition

**Decomposition** (decomposition/strategies.md - By Phase):
- Task A: Design auth schema

```
A → B → [C, D] → E → F → G
      parallel
```

**Tool Output** (`atools/dependency_analyzer.py`):

```json
{
  "specialist": "code-generator",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "rationale": {
    "domain_fit": "Exact domain match: backend",
    "cognitive_process": "Strong alignment: test-first, incremental",
    "cognitive_model": "TDD Practitioner"
  },
  "anti_patterns": []
}
```

**Context Provided** (delegation/context-provision.md):
