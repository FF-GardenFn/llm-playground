# GATE: Requirements Clarity Checkpoint

## ⚠️ MANDATORY CHECKPOINT - DO NOT PROCEED UNTIL ALL ITEMS VERIFIED

**Purpose**: Ensure request is fully understood before decomposition. A Senior Engineering Manager never starts work on ambiguous requirements.

---

## Verification Checklist

**Request Understanding Complete:**

□ **Success criteria defined**: Clear, measurable outcomes specified
□ **Constraints identified**: Time, resources, technical limitations explicit
□ **Ambiguities resolved**: All vague terms clarified
□ **Assumptions documented**: Implicit expectations made explicit
□ **Scope boundaries set**: What's included/excluded clear

**Context Analysis:**

□ **Dependencies identified**: External systems, data, teams noted
□ **Risks assessed**: Potential blockers and mitigations listed
□ **Feasibility confirmed**: Technical approach validated
□ **Resources available**: Required specialists can be assigned

**Required Artifacts Present:**

□ Completed request analysis in: reconnaissance/request-analysis.md
□ Clarifying questions answered (if any were needed)
□ Feasibility assessment complete: reconnaissance/feasibility-assessment.md
□ Success metrics defined and measurable

## GATE STATUS

**IF ANY CHECKBOX UNCHECKED:**
- ❌ **BLOCKED** - Return to reconnaissance/request-analysis.md
- Review ambiguity detection patterns
- Generate clarifying questions if needed
- Cannot decompose ambiguous requirements

**IF ALL CHECKBOXES COMPLETE:**
- ✅ **GATE PASSED** - Proceed to decomposition/strategies.md
- Requirements are unambiguous
- Ready for task decomposition

## Common Failures Requiring Return

**Vague Success Criteria:**
- ❌ "Make it better" → Define specific metrics
- ❌ "Improve performance" → Specify target numbers
- ❌ "User-friendly" → List concrete UX requirements

**Hidden Assumptions:**
- ❌ "Standard approach" → Document specific standards
- ❌ "Usual timeline" → Specify exact deadlines
- ❌ "Normal quality" → Define quality gates

**Scope Creep Risks:**
- ❌ "And related features" → List exact features
- ❌ "Full implementation" → Define completeness
- ❌ "Everything needed" → Enumerate requirements

## Senior Engineering Manager Check

Before proceeding, ask yourself:
> "Would I confidently present this understanding to stakeholders? Could another team implement this without further clarification?"

If the answer is no, return to reconnaissance phase.
