# Success Validation Patterns

## Purpose

Systematically verify that the integrated solution meets all success criteria defined during reconnaissance, ensuring nothing is overlooked before delivery.

---

## Success Criteria Framework

### Well-Defined Success Criteria

**SMART Criteria**:
```
Specific: Exactly what must be achieved
Measurable: Quantifiable verification method
Achievable: Within scope and resources
Relevant: Aligned with user needs
Testable: Can be objectively verified
```

**Example - Poor Success Criteria**:
```markdown
❌ "Make the system fast"
❌ "Improve user experience"
❌ "Add better error handling"
❌ "Enhance security"
```

**Example - Good Success Criteria**:
```markdown
✓ "API responds within 200ms at p95 for 1000 concurrent requests"
✓ "Login form validates email format and displays error within field"
✓ "All user inputs sanitized before database queries"
✓ "Password reset flow completes in <5 user actions"
```

## Validation Dimensions

### Functional Validation

**Core Functionality**:
```markdown
## Verification Checklist

- [ ] All specified features implemented
- [ ] Happy path works end-to-end
- [ ] Edge cases handled correctly
- [ ] Error cases produce expected behavior
- [ ] Integration points functional
```

**Test Cases from Requirements**:
```python
def validate_functional_requirements(solution, requirements):
    """
    Verify each functional requirement
    """
    results = {}

    for req in requirements.functional:
        test = create_test_from_requirement(req)
        results[req.id] = test.execute(solution)

    return all(results.values()), results
```

### Non-Functional Validation

**Performance**:
```markdown
## Performance Criteria

Target: <200ms response time (p95)
Method: Load testing with 1000 concurrent requests

Validation:
```bash
# Run load test
ab -n 10000 -c 1000 http://api/endpoint

# Verify p95 < 200ms
python verify_performance.py --threshold=200
```

Result: ✓ PASS / ✗ FAIL
```

**Scalability**:
```markdown
## Scalability Criteria

Target: Handle 10x current load (10,000 users)
Method: Stress testing with gradual load increase

Validation:
- Current load: 1,000 users → Response time: 150ms
- 5,000 users → Response time: <180ms
- 10,000 users → Response time: <200ms

Result: ✓ System scales linearly
```

**Security**:
```markdown
## Security Criteria

Requirements:
- [ ] All inputs sanitized
- [ ] SQL injection prevented
- [ ] XSS attacks prevented
- [ ] Authentication required
- [ ] Authorization enforced
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted

Validation:
- Manual security review
- Automated security scan
- Penetration testing checklist
```

**Maintainability**:
```markdown
## Maintainability Criteria

Code Quality Metrics:
- Cyclomatic complexity: <10 per function ✓
- Code coverage: >80% ✓
- Documentation: All public APIs documented ✓
- Consistent style: Passes linter ✓
```

## Verification Methods

### Automated Verification

```python
class AutomatedVerifier:
    """Automated success criteria verification"""

    def __init__(self, success_criteria):
        self.criteria = success_criteria

    def verify_all(self, solution):
        """Run all automated checks"""
        results = {
            'unit_tests': self.run_unit_tests(),
            'integration_tests': self.run_integration_tests(),
            'performance_tests': self.run_performance_tests(),
            'security_scan': self.run_security_scan(),
            'code_quality': self.check_code_quality(),
            'coverage': self.check_test_coverage()
        }

        return results

    def run_unit_tests(self):
        """Verify unit test suite passes"""
        result = subprocess.run(['pytest', 'tests/unit'])
        return result.returncode == 0

    def run_integration_tests(self):
        """Verify integration tests pass"""
        result = subprocess.run(['pytest', 'tests/integration'])
        return result.returncode == 0

    def check_test_coverage(self):
        """Verify coverage meets threshold"""
        result = subprocess.run(
            ['pytest', '--cov=src', '--cov-report=json']
        )
        coverage = json.load(open('coverage.json'))
        return coverage['totals']['percent_covered'] >= 80

    def __init__(self, requirements, implementation):
        self.requirements = requirements
        self.implementation = implementation

    def verify_coverage(self):
        """Ensure all requirements addressed"""
        coverage = {}

        for req in self.requirements:
            implementations = self.find_implementations(req)
            tests = self.find_tests(req)

            coverage[req.id] = {
                'requirement': req.description,
                'implemented': bool(implementations),
                'tested': bool(tests),
                'implementation_refs': implementations,
                'test_refs': tests
            }

        return coverage

    def find_missing_requirements(self):
        """Identify unimplemented requirements"""
        coverage = self.verify_coverage()

        missing = [
            req_id for req_id, data in coverage.items()
            if not data['implemented']
        ]

        return missing
```

    """
    Ensure new changes don't break existing functionality
    """
    regressions = []

    # Compare test results
    for test in baseline.tests:
        if test.passed and not current.tests[test.name].passed:
            regressions.append({
                'test': test.name,
                'type': 'functionality',
                'impact': 'Test passed before, fails now'
            })

    # Compare performance
    for metric in baseline.performance:
        old_value = baseline.performance[metric]
        new_value = current.performance[metric]

        if new_value > old_value * 1.2:  # 20% degradation threshold
            regressions.append({
                'metric': metric,
                'type': 'performance',
                'old': old_value,
                'new': new_value,
                'degradation': (new_value / old_value - 1) * 100
            })

    return regressions
```

## Validation Anti-Patterns

### Avoid These Mistakes

**❌ Vague Validation**:
```
Bad: "Looks good to me"
Good: "All 20 success criteria verified, see detailed report"
```

**❌ Partial Validation**:
```
Bad: "Tests pass, ship it" (ignoring performance, security)
Good: Verify all dimensions (functional, performance, security, etc.)
```

**❌ Trusting Without Verification**:
```
Bad: "Specialist said it works"
Good: Independent verification of all claims
```

**❌ Ignoring Edge Cases**:
```
Bad: "Happy path works"
Good: Verify edge cases, error conditions, boundary values
```
