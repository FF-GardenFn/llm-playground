# Example: Legacy Authentication System Refactor

## Scenario

**User Request**: "Our authentication is a mess - it's spread across multiple files with inconsistent patterns, has security issues, and we need to add OAuth support. Please refactor it properly."

**Complexity**: Complex
**Estimated Sequential Time**: 24 hours
**Actual Parallel Time**: 9 hours
**Efficiency Gain**: 62.5%

---

## Phase 1: Reconnaissance (45 minutes)

### Request Analysis

```markdown
## Initial Understanding

**Core Request:** Refactor authentication system

**Red Flags in Request:**
- "mess" (vague, need specifics)
- "security issues" (need to identify)
- "inconsistent patterns" (what patterns?)
- "refactor properly" (what's the target state?)

**This requires deep investigation before proceeding**
```

### Extensive Clarification

```markdown
## Round 1: Understanding Current State

Q: What specific security issues are known?
A: Password hashing inconsistent (some bcrypt, some sha256),
   session tokens not expiring, SQL injection in login endpoint

Q: What inconsistent patterns exist?
A: Some controllers validate input, others don't.
   Error handling returns different formats.
   Some endpoints use middleware auth, others check manually.

Q: What OAuth providers need support?
A: Google and GitHub initially

Q: Can we break existing API contracts?
A: No - must maintain backward compatibility

Q: Timeline?
A: Would like in 2 weeks, but quality over speed

## Round 2: Target Architecture

Q: Centralized auth service or middleware?
A: Prefer centralized service with middleware

Q: JWT or session-based?
A: JWT preferred for scalability

Q: Password policy requirements?
A: Min 8 chars, require special char, number

Q: Session expiration policy?
A: Access token: 1 hour, Refresh token: 30 days
```

### Feasibility Assessment

```markdown
## Feasibility: MODERATE (Proceed with Caution)

**Complexity: HIGH**
- Security-critical system
- Backward compatibility requirement
- Multiple integration points
- OAuth adds significant scope

**Risks:**

- 🔴 HIGH: Security regressions
- 🟡 MEDIUM: OAuth integration complexity
- 🟡 MEDIUM: Database migration on live system

**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive testing
- Gradual rollout plan
- Security auditor required
- Staging environment validation

**Estimated Effort:**
- Architecture design: 2 hours
- Security audit: 3 hours
- Implementation: 14 hours
- Testing: 4 hours
- Documentation: 1 hour
Total: 24 hours sequential

**Verdict:** Proceed with security focus and phased rollout

### Integration Strategy

```markdown
## Integration Approach: Incremental

**Integration Point 1:** After Layer 1
- Verify AuthService, Database, Middleware work together
- Run basic integration tests
- Validate interfaces

**Integration Point 2:** After Layer 2
- Integrate each auth method with core
- Test each independently
- Then test interactions

**Integration Point 3:** Final
- Full system integration
- Comprehensive testing
- Security validation
- Performance verification

**Rollout Strategy:**
1. Deploy to staging
2. Test with subset of users (canary)
3. Monitor for issues
4. Gradual rollout to production
5. Keep old system available for rollback
```

### Example Delegation: Task 3

```markdown
## Task 3: AuthService Core Implementation

**Assigned to:** Code Generator #1
**Duration:** 2.5 hours
**Dependencies:** Tasks 1 (security requirements), Task 2 (architecture)

---

### Context

You are implementing the core AuthService that centralizes all authentication logic.

### Objectives

Create AuthService class with:
1. JWT generation and validation
2. Password hashing (bcrypt, 12 rounds)
3. Token storage and retrieval
4. Audit logging for auth events

### Architecture (from Task 2)

```python
class AuthService:
    def __init__(self, db_session, config):
        pass

    # Password methods
    def hash_password(self, password: str) -> str
    def verify_password(self, password: str, hash: str) -> bool

    # Token methods
    def generate_tokens(self, user_id: str) -> tuple[str, str]
    def validate_access_token(self, token: str) -> dict
    def refresh_access_token(self, refresh_token: str) -> str
    def revoke_token(self, token: str) -> None

    # Audit methods
    def log_auth_event(self, event_type: str, user_id: str, metadata: dict) -> None
```

### Security Requirements (from Task 1)

- **MUST** use bcrypt with 12 rounds
- **MUST** use RS256 for JWT signing
- **MUST NOT** log passwords or tokens
- **MUST** validate all inputs
- **MUST** implement rate limiting hooks

### Success Criteria

- [ ] All methods implemented
- [ ] Unit tests >90% coverage
- [ ] No passwords in logs
- [ ] Token expiration correct (1h access, 30d refresh)
- [ ] Security requirements satisfied
- [ ] Documentation complete

### Integration Points

**Inputs from:**
- Task 2: Architecture specification
- Task 4: Database schema (for token storage)

**Used by:**
- Task 6: Local authentication
- Task 7, 8: OAuth providers
- Task 9: Password reset

### Examples

```python
# Example usage
auth_service = AuthService(db, config)

# Hash password
hashed = auth_service.hash_password("SecurePass123!")
assert auth_service.verify_password("SecurePass123!", hashed)

# Generate tokens
access, refresh = auth_service.generate_tokens(user_id="user_123")
assert len(access) > 0

# Validate token
payload = auth_service.validate_access_token(access)
assert payload['user_id'] == "user_123"
```

### Critical Issues Encountered

```markdown
## Issue #1 (Hour 3.5)

**Problem:** Task 4 (Database) discovered Task 3 (AuthService) needs additional column for OAuth provider tracking

**Impact:** Blocks Task 7, 8 (OAuth tasks)

**Resolution:**
1. Quick consultation between Database Specialist and Code Gen #1
2. Added oauth_provider column to schema
3. Updated AuthService interface
4. 20-minute delay absorbed by buffer

**Lesson:** OAuth requirements should have been more explicit in architecture phase

## Issue #2 (Hour 5)

**Problem:** Task 7 (Google OAuth) reports Google API rate limiting during testing

**Impact:** Slowing down development testing

**Resolution:**
1. Implemented mock for development
2. Real OAuth testing scheduled for integration phase
3. No timeline impact

## Issue #3 (Hour 7)

**Problem:** Task 12 (Security review) identified timing attack vulnerability in password verification

**Impact:** Security issue, must fix before delivery

**Resolution:**
1. Security Auditor identified constant-time comparison needed
2. Code Gen #2 implemented fix in 15 minutes
3. Re-review passed
4. Timeline impact: 15 minutes
```
