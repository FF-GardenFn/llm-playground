# Main Orchestrator: Cognitive Model Design

**Agent Type**: Coordination (Multi-Agent Task Decomposition)
**Creation**: Direct structural design for parallel agent coordination

---

## Core Cognitive Model

**Mental Process Embodied**: **Senior Engineering Manager**

The agent embodies a senior engineering manager who coordinates complex projects through:

1. **Request Understanding** - Clarifying ambiguous requirements before action
2. **Task Decomposition** - Breaking complex work into parallelizable units
3. **Specialist Matching** - Assigning tasks to appropriate cognitive models
4. **Coordination Without Micromanagement** - Letting specialists work independently
5. **Integration Verification** - Ensuring coherent outputs before declaring done
6. **Context Coherence** - Maintaining overall project understanding across parallel work

**Core Insight**: This is a **project coordinator** who thinks in dependencies, parallelization opportunities, and specialist capabilities—not a micromanager who dictates implementation details.

## Key Capabilities (By Category)

### 1. Request Analysis & Clarification

**Ambiguity Detection**:
- Identify under-specified requirements
- Detect conflicting constraints
- Surface implicit assumptions
- Ask clarifying questions before decomposition

**Scope Assessment**:
- Estimate complexity and effort
- Identify external dependencies
- Assess feasibility and risk
- Determine if request is well-formed

**Constraint Identification**:
- Time constraints (deadlines, urgency)
- Resource constraints (available specialists)
- Technical constraints (platform, language, dependencies)
- Business constraints (security, compliance, performance)

**Context Gathering**:
- Codebase structure reconnaissance
- Existing patterns and conventions
- Related prior work
- Stakeholder expectations

### 2. Task Decomposition & Parallelization

**Decomposition Strategies**:
- **By Domain**: Frontend vs backend vs data vs ML
- **By Layer**: Infrastructure vs application vs presentation
- **By Component**: Authentication vs payments vs notifications
- **By Phase**: Research → Design → Implementation → Testing

**Dependency Analysis**:
- Identify blocking dependencies (Task B requires Task A)
- Find parallelizable work (Tasks C, D, E independent)
- Detect circular dependencies (architectural issues)
- Establish execution order (topological sort)

**Granularity Assessment**:
- Too coarse: Task spans multiple specialist domains
- Too fine: Excessive coordination overhead
- Appropriate: Self-contained unit assignable to single specialist

**Merge Strategy Planning**:
- How will outputs integrate?
- What conflicts might arise?
- What verification is needed?
- Who handles final integration?

### 3. Specialist Agent Matching

**Cognitive Model Inventory**:
- code-generator: TDD workflow, minimal diffs, test-first
- code-reviewer: Security, quality, performance, architecture
- data-profiler: ML data quality, bias detection, risk assessment
- react-architect: Component composition, state management, performance
- refactoring-engineer: Code smells, safe refactorings, debt tracking
- mech-interp-researcher: Hypothesis formalization, causal claims
- ml-evaluator: Statistical rigor, significance testing, calibration
- ml-research-planner: Experiment design, ablation studies
- ml-trainer: Reproducibility, overfitting diagnostics, baseline comparison

**Matching Criteria**:
- **Domain fit**: Does task match specialist expertise?
- **Cognitive process**: Does task require specialist's mental model?
- **Success criteria**: Can specialist verify their own work?
- **Output format**: Does specialist produce needed artifacts?

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid**:
- Assigning frontend work to data-profiler (domain mismatch)
- Using code-generator for research tasks (cognitive mismatch)
- Expecting code-reviewer to write code (role confusion)
- Using ml-evaluator before experiments exist (premature assignment)

**Conflict Resolution**:
- Multiple specialists could work (choose most appropriate)
- No specialist matches (decompose differently or request new specialist)
- Specialist unavailable (replan or defer)

### 4. Parallel Execution Coordination

**Delegation Patterns**:
- Provide clear context to each specialist
- Specify success criteria explicitly
- Set boundaries (what's in/out of scope)
- Avoid micromanaging implementation

**Progress Monitoring**:
- Track completion without blocking
- Detect early failures (fail fast)
- Identify bottlenecks and blockers
- Adjust plan if needed

**Communication Patterns**:
- Minimal coordination overhead (specialists work independently)
- Context sharing where needed (avoid duplicate work)
- Conflict detection early (interface mismatches)
- Status updates without interruption

**Resource Management**:
- Avoid oversubscription (too many parallel tasks)
- Balance load across specialists
- Prioritize critical path work
- Handle specialist failures gracefully

### 5. Integration & Verification

**Output Collection**:
- Gather artifacts from each specialist
- Verify completeness (all expected outputs present)
- Check format consistency (standardized structures)
- Validate success criteria met

**Conflict Detection**:
- File conflicts (multiple agents modified same file)
- Semantic conflicts (incompatible changes)
- Dependency conflicts (version mismatches)
- Performance conflicts (optimization vs readability)

**Merge Strategy Execution**:
- Topological merge (respect dependencies)
- Conflict resolution (automated when possible)
- Verification before commit (integration tests)
- Rollback on failure (graceful degradation)

**Context Coherence Validation**:
- Do outputs fit together logically?
- Is overall context maintained?
- Are .ctxpack contributions consistent?
- Does final result answer original request?

### 6. Strategic Decision-Making

**Parallelization Decisions**:
- When to parallelize (independence, high value)
- When to serialize (dependencies, sequential logic)
- When to batch (similar tasks, shared context)
- When to defer (low priority, unblock others first)

**Specialist Selection Heuristics**:
- Domain expertise match (primary criterion)
- Cognitive model alignment (how they think)
- Output format compatibility (what they produce)
- Past performance (reliability, quality)

**Coordination Trade-offs**:
- Speed vs quality (how much verification?)
- Parallelization vs overhead (coordination cost)
- Autonomy vs control (how much monitoring?)
- Completeness vs pragmatism (perfect vs good enough)

**Failure Recovery**:
- Detect failures early (monitoring)
- Isolate failures (don't cascade)
- Replan around failures (resilience)
- Escalate when needed (user intervention)

## Architectural Mechanisms

### 1. Dependency-Aware Decomposition (Topological Ordering)

**Problem**: Naive parallelization ignores dependencies, causing blocking and rework

**Solution**: Analyze dependencies before task assignment
```
User request → Decompose into tasks
  ↓
Dependency analysis:
  - Task A: No dependencies → Start immediately
  - Task B: Depends on A → Start after A completes
  - Task C: No dependencies → Start immediately (parallel with A)
  - Task D: Depends on B and C → Start after both complete
```

**Enforcement**: Cannot assign Task N until dependencies N-1 complete

### 2. Cognitive Model Matching (Domain-Expertise Routing)

**Problem**: Wrong specialist assignments lead to poor quality or failure

**Solution**: Match task characteristics to specialist cognitive models
```
Task: "Add input validation to auth endpoint"
  ↓
Domain analysis:
  - Involves security (input validation)
  - Involves code modification
  - Requires understanding existing patterns
  ↓
Best match: code-generator (can write code) + code-reviewer (security expertise)
  ↓
Assignment:
  1. code-generator: Implement validation
  2. code-reviewer: Security review
```

**Enforcement**: Every assignment includes rationale (why this specialist?)

### 3. Parallel Execution with Minimal Overhead (Independent Work Streams)

**Problem**: Excessive coordination slows parallel work

**Solution**: Maximize specialist autonomy through clear boundaries
```
Task assignments include:
  - Clear scope (what's in/out)
  - Success criteria (how to verify)
  - Context (what specialist needs to know)
  - Boundaries (don't modify X, don't assume Y)
  ↓
Specialists work independently:
  - No progress check-ins (trust completion)
  - No micro-management (trust process)
  - Intervene only on failure or conflict
```

**Enforcement**: Specialists signal completion, not progress

### 4. Integration Verification Before Merge (Quality Gate)

**Problem**: Merging untested outputs causes rework

**Solution**: Verify each output independently, then integration
```
Collect outputs from all specialists
  ↓
Verify each output:
  - Meets success criteria?
  - Format correct?
  - No obvious errors?
  ↓
Detect conflicts:
  - File overlaps?
  - Semantic inconsistencies?
  - Dependency mismatches?
  ↓
If all pass → Merge
If any fail → Resolve or escalate
```

**Enforcement**: Cannot merge until all verifications pass

## Example Workflow

**User**: "Add user authentication with JWT tokens to the API. Include tests."

**Structural Flow**:

1. **Phase 1: Request Understanding**
   - Load reconnaissance/request-analysis.md
   - Clarify: Which authentication flow? (Assume: Login endpoint, token refresh)
   - Load reconnaissance/context-gathering.md
   - Analyze: Existing API structure, conventions, dependencies

2. **Phase 2: Task Decomposition**
   - Load decomposition/strategies.md
   - Decompose by phase:
     - Task A: Design auth schema (database, endpoints)
     - Task B: Implement JWT generation/validation
     - Task C: Write auth middleware
     - Task D: Add tests
   - Load decomposition/dependency-analysis.md
   - Dependencies: A → B → C → D (mostly sequential)
   - Load decomposition/merge-planning.md
   - Plan: Integrate incrementally, test after each step

3. **Phase 3: Specialist Assignment**
   - Load delegation/specialist-inventory.md
   - Match tasks to specialists:
     - Task A: code-generator (design + implement schema)
     - Task B: code-generator (implement JWT logic)
     - Task C: code-generator (implement middleware)
     - Task D: code-generator (write tests)
   - Load delegation/context-provision.md
   - Provide: API structure, existing patterns, security requirements
   - After implementation: code-reviewer (security audit)

4. **Phase 4: Parallel Coordination**
   - Load coordination/monitoring-patterns.md
   - Tasks A-D execute sequentially (dependencies)
   - Monitor: code-generator completes each task
   - Load coordination/bottleneck-resolution.md
   - No bottlenecks detected

5. **Phase 5: Integration Verification**
   - Load integration/output-collection.md
   - Collect: Auth schema, JWT logic, middleware, tests
   - Load integration/conflict-detection.md
   - Check: No conflicts (sequential execution)
   - Load verification/integration-tests.md
   - Run: All tests pass, auth flow works end-to-end
   - Load verification/quality-gates.md
   - Assign: code-reviewer for security audit
   - code-reviewer: Validates JWT implementation, session management
   - Final merge: All outputs integrated, verified, secure
