## Purpose

Define the quality benchmarks that distinguish excellent orchestration from adequate delegation, ensuring world-class specialist coordination.

## Orchestration Quality Dimensions

### Efficiency: Minimizing Total Time

**World-Class Benchmark**:
```
Parallelization Efficiency = Parallel Work Time / Sequential Work Time

Target: >60% of work parallelizable
Excellence: >70% parallelizable
Poor: <40% parallelizable
```

**Metrics**:
```
Total Sequential Time: Sum of all task durations
Total Parallel Time: Critical path duration
Efficiency Gain: (Sequential - Parallel) / Sequential

Example:
Sequential: 20 hours
Parallel: 8 hours (critical path)
Efficiency Gain: 60%
```

**Quality Indicators**:
```
✓ Critical path identified and optimized
✓ Non-critical work parallelized maximally
✓ Dependencies accurately tracked
✓ Minimal idle specialist time
✓ No artificial serialization
```

---

### Clarity: Unambiguous Delegation

**World-Class Benchmark**:
```
Clarification Request Rate: <0.5 per task
Revision Rate: <0.2 per task
First-Time-Right Rate: >80%
```

**Quality Indicators**:
```
✓ Success criteria crystal clear
✓ Interfaces precisely defined
✓ Constraints explicitly stated
✓ Examples provided for ambiguous cases
✓ Scope boundaries unambiguous
```

**Poor Delegation Signs**:
```
❌ Specialist asks multiple clarifying questions
❌ Output doesn't match expectations
❌ Requires significant rework
❌ Scope creep during implementation
❌ Integration issues due to misunderstandings
```

---

### Completeness: Nothing Overlooked

**World-Class Benchmark**:
```
Coverage: 100% of requirements addressed
Verification: 100% of success criteria validated
Integration: 0 broken references or missing pieces
```

**Completeness Checklist**:
```
□ All requirements decomposed into tasks
□ All tasks assigned to specialists
□ All dependencies identified
□ All interfaces defined
□ All success criteria testable
□ All outputs integrated
□ All edge cases considered
□ All quality gates passed
```

**Missing Work Detection**:
```python
def verify_completeness(requirements, implementation):
    """
    Ensure nothing overlooked
    """
    missing = []

    # Check requirement coverage
    for req in requirements:
        if not has_implementation(req, implementation):
            missing.append(f"Requirement {req.id} not implemented")

    # Check integration completeness
    for task in implementation.tasks:
        if not is_integrated(task, implementation):
            missing.append(f"Task {task.id} not integrated")

    # Check dependency satisfaction
    for dep in implementation.dependencies:
        if not is_satisfied(dep):
            missing.append(f"Dependency {dep} not satisfied")

    return missing
```

### Quality: Excellence in Execution

**Code Quality Standards**:
```

**Review Standards**:
```
Every deliverable reviewed for:

□ Clarity: Is code readable?
□ Consistency: Matches existing patterns?
□ Security: No vulnerabilities?
□ Performance: Meets targets?
```

✓ Dependencies explicit and minimal
✓ High parallelization potential (>60%)
✓ Clear integration strategy
```

**Poor Decomposition Signs**:
```
❌ Tasks too coarse (>4 hours)

❌ Artificial boundaries
❌ Hidden dependencies
❌ Sequential when could be parallel
```

**Quality Metrics**:
```python
def assess_decomposition_quality(tasks, dependencies):
    """
    Score decomposition quality
    """
    scores = {
        'granularity': assess_granularity(tasks),  # 0-10
        'parallelization': compute_parallelization(tasks, dependencies),  # 0-10
        'coupling': measure_coupling(dependencies),  # 0-10 (10 = low coupling)
        'completeness': verify_coverage(tasks),  # 0-10
    }

    total = sum(scores.values())

    if total >= 35:
        return "EXCELLENT"
    elif total >= 28:
        return "GOOD"
    elif total >= 20:

## Quality Anti-Patterns

### Avoid These Orchestration Mistakes

**❌ Over-Optimization**:
```
Bad: Spend 2 hours optimizing to save 15 minutes
Good: Optimize where impact is significant
```

**❌ Premature Delegation**:
```
Bad: Delegate before requirements clear
Good: Clarify fully, then delegate with confidence
```

**❌ Micro-Management**:
```
Bad: Constant check-ins, detailed implementation guidance
Good: Clear specification, trust specialist, verify outcomes
```

**❌ Under-Specification**:
```
Bad: "Make it work" with no success criteria
Good: Precise requirements, examples, acceptance criteria
```

**❌ Integration Neglect**:
```
Bad: "They'll figure it out during merge"
Good: Integration strategy defined upfront
```

## The Orchestration Excellence Mindset

```
"A Senior Engineering Manager thinks:

1. Can this be parallelized? (Efficiency)
2. Is this specification unambiguous? (Clarity)
3. Have I missed anything? (Completeness)
4. Will this meet our quality bar? (Quality)
5. Will this integrate coherently? (Coherence)

Every decision optimizes for these five dimensions."
```

*Quality orchestration isn't just about completing work—it's about delivering an integrated, coherent, excellent solution efficiently. These standards define the bar for world-class orchestration.*
