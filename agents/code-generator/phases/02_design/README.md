# Design Phase

## Purpose
Plan minimal, safe approach before implementation. Identify components, assess risks, choose patterns.

## Key Activities
- Propose structure (files to modify/create, functions/classes to add)
- Choose patterns (reuse existing or justify new)
- Plan data flow (input → processing → output)
- Identify risks and mitigations
- Define testing strategy

## Input Dependencies
Requires: `../01_reconnaissance/outputs/reconnaissance_report.md`

Cannot proceed without reconnaissance complete.

## Output Artifact
Creates: `outputs/design_proposal.md`

Must include:
- Approach (high-level strategy)
- Components (what to build, where)
- Justification (why this approach, which patterns)
- Risks and mitigations
- Testing plan

## Example
See: example_proposal.md for complete demonstration
