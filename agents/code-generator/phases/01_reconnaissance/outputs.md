# Reconnaissance Outputs

## Required Artifact
**File:** `outputs/reconnaissance_report.md`

**Must Include:**
- Feature request restated (demonstrates understanding)
- Similar implementations found with file paths (shows what exists and where)
- Existing patterns identified (naming conventions, architectures, testing approaches)
- Integration points mapped (which layers/files affected)
- Files to modify/create listed (specific paths)
- Testing strategy identified (how similar code is tested)

## Verification
Phase 2 (Design) requires this artifact with all sections populated.
Cannot proceed to design without completing reconnaissance.

## Next Phase
Design phase requires: `outputs/reconnaissance_report.md`
