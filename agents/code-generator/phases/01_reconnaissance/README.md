# Reconnaissance Phase

## Purpose
Understand the codebase, identify patterns, and locate integration points before writing any code.

## Key Activities
- Search for similar implementations using search_codebase.py
- Identify naming conventions and architectural patterns
- Map affected layers (API, service, data, UI)
- Locate existing utilities that can be reused
- Understand testing strategies used in codebase

## Available Tools
- **search_codebase.py** - Find patterns, functions, classes
  - See SKILLS.md for search strategies and pattern recognition

## Output Artifact
Creates: `outputs/reconnaissance_report.md`

Must include:
- Similar implementations found (with file locations)
- Existing patterns identified
- Integration points mapped
- Files to modify/create
- Testing strategy

## Example
See: example_report.md for complete demonstration
