- ✅ Diagnostics checklist complete

**Gate**: Cannot start Phase 4 without Phase 3 complete

---

## When to Enter Phase 4

### Entry Scenario 1: Targeted Optimization (Single Issue)

**From Phase 3**:
- Clear single root cause identified (e.g., pure overfitting)
- 3-5 specific recommendations
- Expected improvement >5%

**Phase 4 Strategy**: Implement recommendations, train once, evaluate

**Duration**: 1-2 hours

---

### Entry Scenario 2: Comprehensive Optimization (Multiple Issues)

**From Phase 3**:
- Multiple root causes (e.g., overfitting + resource inefficiency)
- Broader optimization needed
- Expected improvement >10%

**Phase 4 Strategy**: Implement all recommendations, possibly hyperparameter sweep

**Duration**: 4-8 hours

---

### Entry Scenario 3: Skip Phase 4 (Baseline Sufficient)

**From Phase 3**:
- Diagnostic reveals baseline near-optimal
- Improvement potential <3%
- Time constraints

**Action**: Skip Phase 4, proceed to Phase 5 (Finalization)

---

## Optimization Strategies

### Strategy 1: Targeted Optimization → `strategies/targeted.md`

**When to Use**:
- Single clear issue (e.g., overfitting)
- Specific recommendations from Phase 3
- Time budget <2 hours

**Approach**:
1. Implement top 3-5 recommendations from Phase 3
2. Create optimization_config.yaml with changes
3. Train once with new config
4. Evaluate improvements
5. If sufficient → Phase 5, else iterate

**Example** (Overfitting):
```yaml
# Changes from baseline_config.yaml
model:
  dropout: 0.4  # NEW: Anti-overfitting

optimizer:
  weight_decay: 1e-4  # NEW: L2 regularization

early_stopping:
  patience: 5  # CHANGED: From 10

data_augmentation:  # NEW
  enabled: true
```

**Expected Duration**: 1-2 hours (1 training run)

---

### Strategy 2: Hyperparameter Sweep → `strategies/hyperparameter_sweep.md`

**When to Use**:
- Multiple issues or unclear optimal settings
- Time budget 4-8 hours
- Need to explore hyperparameter space

**Approach**:
1. Define search space (LR, dropout, weight decay, etc.)
2. Choose search method (grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization)
3. Run multiple training trials
4. Select best configuration
5. Re-train with best config for final model

**Example Search Space**:
```yaml
hyperparameter_search:
  method: random_search
  n_trials: 20

  search_space:
    learning_rate: [1e-4, 1e-3, 1e-2]
    dropout: [0.3, 0.4, 0.5]
    weight_decay: [1e-5, 1e-4, 1e-3]
    batch_size: [32, 64, 128]
```

**Expected Duration**: 4-8 hours (20+ training runs)

---

### Strategy 3: Iterative Refinement → `strategies/iterative.md`

**When to Use**:
- Initial optimizations promising but insufficient
- Need multiple rounds of refinement
- Complex performance landscape

**Approach**:
1. Implement Phase 3 recommendations (Iteration 1)
2. Train and evaluate
3. Analyze new results (mini Phase 3)
4. Generate new recommendations (refined)
5. Implement and train again (Iteration 2)
6. Repeat until convergence or time budget exhausted

**Expected Duration**: 3-6 hours (2-3 iterations)

---

## Configuration

**Template**: `configs/optimization_template.yaml`

### Baseline vs Optimization Config

**Baseline** (from Phase 2):
```yaml
model:
  architecture: ResNet18
  dropout: 0.0  # No dropout

optimizer:
  type: Adam
  learning_rate: 1e-3
  weight_decay: 0.0  # No L2 regularization

training:
  epochs: 20
  batch_size: 32

early_stopping:
  patience: 10

data_augmentation:
  enabled: false  # No augmentation
```

**Optimization** (with Phase 3 recommendations):
```yaml
model:
  architecture: ResNet18
  dropout: 0.4  # NEW: Anti-overfitting

optimizer:
  type: Adam
  learning_rate: 1e-3
  weight_decay: 1e-4  # NEW: L2 regularization

training:
  epochs: 50  # Increased (early stopping will control)
  batch_size: 32

early_stopping:
  patience: 5  # CHANGED: More aggressive

data_augmentation:  # NEW: Data augmentation
  enabled: true
  transforms:
    - random_crop: [32, 32]
    - horizontal_flip: {p: 0.5}
    - color_jitter: {brightness: 0.2, contrast: 0.2}
```

## Common Optimization Patterns

### Pattern 1: Anti-Overfitting Optimization

**Phase 3 Diagnosis**: Overfitting (train-val gap >15%)

**Optimizations**:
1. Add dropout (0.3-0.5)
2. Add weight decay (1e-4)
3. Enable data augmentation
4. Reduce early stopping patience
5. Optionally reduce model capacity

**Expected Result**: Train acc decreases slightly, val acc increases significantly, gap narrows

**Example**:
- Before: Train 95% / Val 72% (gap 23%)
- After: Train 89% / Val 81% (gap 8%)
- Val improvement: +9%

---

### Pattern 2: Anti-Underfitting Optimization

**Phase 3 Diagnosis**: Underfitting (both train and val low)

**Optimizations**:
1. Increase model capacity (more layers/units)
2. Increase learning rate (10x)
3. Train longer (2-5x epochs)
4. Improve feature engineering
5. Remove excessive regularization if present

**Expected Result**: Both train and val acc increase

**Example**:
- Before: Train 68% / Val 66%
- After: Train 82% / Val 80%
- Val improvement: +14%

---

### Pattern 3: Learning Rate Tuning

**Phase 3 Diagnosis**: Suboptimal learning rate (too high or too low)

**Optimizations**:
1. LR too high (NaN loss, instability): Reduce by 10x
2. LR too low (slow convergence, plateau): Increase by 10x
3. Use LR scheduler (ReduceLROnPlateau, CosineAnnealing)
4. Consider warmup schedule

**Expected Result**: Faster convergence, better final performance

**Example** (LR too low):
- Before: LR=1e-3, Train 68% / Val 66% (plateaued early)
- After: LR=1e-2, Train 82% / Val 80%
- Val improvement: +14%

---

### Pattern 4: Data Augmentation

**Phase 3 Diagnosis**: Overfitting on small dataset

**Optimizations**:
1. Enable standard augmentations (crop, flip, color jitter)
2. Use task-appropriate transforms (rotation for digits, cutout for images)
3. Adjust augmentation strength (mild → moderate → aggressive)
4. Mixup/Cutmix for advanced augmentation

**Expected Result**: Val acc increases, train acc may decrease slightly

**Example**:
- Before: No augmentation, Val 72%
- After: RandomCrop, HFlip, ColorJitter, Val 78%
- Val improvement: +6%

---

## Evaluation and Comparison

### Metrics to Compare

1. **Primary Metric**: Val Accuracy (or val loss)
   - Baseline: 72.3%
   - Optimized: 81.2%
   - Improvement: +8.9% absolute (12% relative)

2. **Train-Val Gap**: Measure of overfitting
   - Baseline: 22.9% gap
   - Optimized: 7.4% gap
   - Improvement: Gap reduced by 15.5%

3. **Training Efficiency**:
   - Time per epoch: 2m 12s (baseline) vs 2m 45s (optimized with aug)
   - GPU utilization: 73% vs 78%

4. **Convergence**:
   - Epochs to best: 5 (baseline) vs 22 (optimized - trains longer)
   - Final epoch: 15 (early stopped) vs 30 (early stopped)

### Statistical Significance

**Question**: Is the improvement real or noise?

**Method**: Multiple runs with different seeds

```python
# Run optimized config 5 times with different seeds
seeds = [42, 43, 44, 45, 46]
val_accs = []

for seed in seeds:
    model = train(config=optimization_config, seed=seed)
    val_acc = evaluate(model, val_loader)
    val_accs.append(val_acc)

mean_val_acc = np.mean(val_accs)
std_val_acc = np.std(val_accs)

print(f"Optimized Val Acc: {mean_val_acc:.1f}% ± {std_val_acc:.1f}%")
print(f"Baseline Val Acc: 72.3%")

# Is improvement significant?
if mean_val_acc - 2*std_val_acc > 72.3:
    print("Improvement statistically significant (p<0.05)")
```

**Expected**: Mean improvement >3% with low variance (<1% std) indicates real improvement
