# Example Investigation: Attention-Based Error Correction

## Hypothesis

**Primary Claim**: Specific attention heads implement error detection and correction by comparing current predictions with context.

**Mechanistic Specificity**:
- Layer 5, Heads 3-5: Error detection circuit
- Layer 6, Head 2: Correction signal generation
- Layer 7-8: Correction application

---

## Investigation Design

### Phase 1: Hypothesis Formalization

**Components Identified**:
```python
error_detection_heads = [f"L5H{i}" for i in range(3, 6)]
correction_head = "L6H2"
application_layers = [7, 8]
```

**Predicted Mechanism**:
1. L5H3-5 attend to positions with high prediction error
2. L6H2 computes correction vectors
3. L7-8 apply corrections to residual stream

### Phase 2: Alternative Hypotheses

**Alternative 1**: Pattern Memorization
- No error computation, just memorized fixes
- Test: Novel errors should fail

**Alternative 2**: Distributed Correction
- Many heads contribute small corrections
- Test: Ablating single heads has minimal effect

**Alternative 3**: Feed-Forward Correction
- MLPs, not attention, perform correction
- Test: Attention ablation doesn't affect correction

### Phase 3: Experimental Protocol

```python
def test_error_correction_hypothesis():
    # 1. Create controlled errors
    errors = generate_systematic_errors()

    # 2. Measure attention patterns
    attention_patterns = get_attention_weights(error_detection_heads)

    # 3. Ablation tests
    for head in error_detection_heads:
        performance_drop = ablate_and_measure(head)

    # 4. Activation intervention
    force_activate_correction = intervene_on_activations(correction_head)

    # 5. Novel error generalization
    novel_errors = generate_out_of_distribution_errors()
    generalization = test_on_novel(novel_errors)
```

## Experimental Results

### Attention Pattern Analysis

**Expected Patterns**:
```
Position with error: High attention from L5H3-5
Position without error: Low attention from L5H3-5
Correlation coefficient: >0.7
```

**Control Patterns**:
```
Random positions: No systematic attention
Other heads: Different attention patterns
Early layers: No error-specific attention
```

### Ablation Studies

**Critical Head Ablation**:
```python
results = {
    "L5H3_ablated": {"accuracy_drop": 15, "error_detection": -60},
    "L5H4_ablated": {"accuracy_drop": 12, "error_detection": -55},
    "L5H5_ablated": {"accuracy_drop": 18, "error_detection": -65},
    "L6H2_ablated": {"accuracy_drop": 25, "error_correction": -80},
    "control_head": {"accuracy_drop": 2, "error_detection": -5}
}
```

### Causal Intervention

**Force Error Signal**:
```python
# Artificially inject error signal
intervention_results = {
    "forced_error_signal": {
        "triggers_correction": True,
        "correction_magnitude": 0.8,
        "affects_non_errors": True  # Key evidence
    }
}
```

## Controls and Validation

### Negative Controls
1. **No-error inputs**: Heads should not activate
2. **Random noise**: Should not trigger systematic correction
3. **Shuffled tokens**: Error detection should fail

### Positive Controls
1. **Known errors**: Should reliably trigger detection
2. **Amplified errors**: Should show stronger activation
3. **Multiple errors**: Should handle simultaneously

### Statistical Validation
```python
# Bootstrap confidence intervals
bootstrap_ci = {
    "attention_correlation": (0.72, 0.81),
    "ablation_effect": (0.15, 0.22),
    "intervention_causality": (0.65, 0.78)
}

# Multiple hypothesis correction
adjusted_p_values = bonferroni_correction(raw_p_values)
```

---

## Alternative Hypothesis Results

### Testing Memorization Hypothesis
```python
novel_error_results = {
    "seen_errors": 0.92,  # High correction rate
    "novel_errors": 0.87,  # Still high!
    "conclusion": "Not pure memorization"
}
```

### Testing Distributed Hypothesis
```python
cumulative_ablation = {
    "single_head": 0.15,  # Significant effect
    "two_heads": 0.35,     # More than additive
    "three_heads": 0.65,   # Circuit breaks
    "conclusion": "Specialized, not distributed"
}
```

## Implications and Predictions

### Model Behavior Predictions
1. Errors in familiar domains: Quick correction
2. Errors in novel domains: Attempted correction, possibly wrong
3. Cascading errors: System may oscillate
4. Error-free input: Circuit remains quiet

### Generalization Predictions
1. Similar architectures: Same heads likely involved
2. Smaller models: Circuit may not exist
3. Larger models: More sophisticated error correction

### Practical Applications
1. **Debugging**: Monitor these heads for error detection
2. **Improvement**: Enhance circuit for better correction
3. **Safety**: Detect when model is uncertain/correcting
