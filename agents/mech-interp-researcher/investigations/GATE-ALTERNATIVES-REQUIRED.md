# GATE: Alternative Mechanisms Checkpoint

## ⚠️ MANDATORY CHECKPOINT - COMPETING EXPLANATIONS REQUIRED

**Purpose**: Ensure multiple alternative mechanisms are generated before experimental design. Scientific rigor demands considering competing explanations.

---

## Verification Checklist

**Alternative Mechanisms Generated:**

□ **Minimum 3 alternatives** documented (4 preferred)
□ **Each mechanistically specific**: Not vague alternatives
□ **Mutually exclusive**: Alternatives are genuinely different
□ **Testably different**: Each makes distinct predictions

**Alternative Types Covered:**

□ **Simpler mechanism**: Occam's razor alternative
□ **Reverse causation**: Effect might cause presumed cause
□ **Spurious correlation**: Third factor causes both
□ **Compositional explanation**: Multiple small mechanisms vs single large

**Differential Predictions:**

□ **Distinguishing experiments** identified for each pair
□ **Specific interventions** that would favor one over another
□ **Observable differences** in model behavior predicted
□ **Null hypothesis** explicitly stated

## Required Artifacts from Previous Phases

**Must build on:**
- ✓ Mechanistically specific hypothesis (Phase 1)
- ✓ Framework context established (Phase 2)
- ✓ Previous gates passed

**These alternatives must be consistent with framework selected in Phase 2.**

## GATE STATUS

**IF FEWER THAN 3 ALTERNATIVES:**
- ❌ **BLOCKED** - Cannot proceed with single hypothesis
- Return to investigations/WORKFLOW.md
- Generate required alternatives
- Scientific method demands multiple hypotheses

**IF ALTERNATIVES NOT SPECIFIC:**
- ❌ **BLOCKED** - Vague alternatives don't count
- Each must be mechanistically specific
- Each must make testable predictions

**IF ALL REQUIREMENTS MET:**
- ✅ **GATE PASSED** - Proceed to investigation design
- Multiple hypotheses ready for testing
- Differential predictions established

## Examples of Strong vs Weak Alternatives

**Strong Alternatives (Specific & Testable):**
- ✅ "Attention head 5.2 implements AND gate via multiplicative interaction"
- ✅ "Pattern emerges from distributed residual stream addition, not single head"
- ✅ "Behavior is memorized in MLP, not computed by attention"

**Weak Alternatives (Vague & Untestable):**
- ❌ "Model might use different approach"
- ❌ "Could involve other components"
- ❌ "Maybe happens differently"

## Alternative Generation Prompts

If struggling to generate alternatives, consider:

1. **What's the simplest possible mechanism?**
   - Remove components until it breaks
   - Could a linear function suffice?

2. **What if causation is reversed?**
   - Does A cause B, or B cause A?
   - Or does C cause both?

3. **What if it's distributed, not localized?**
   - Many small contributions vs one big mechanism
   - Ensemble effect vs single component

4. **What if it's memorization, not computation?**
   - Lookup table vs algorithm
   - Pattern matching vs reasoning

---

## Documentation Requirements

**For each alternative, document:**
1. Specific mechanism description
2. Components involved
3. Unique predictions
4. How to distinguish from primary hypothesis
5. What intervention would support/refute
