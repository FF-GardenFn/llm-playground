## Core Parallels

**Neural Networks ↔ Biological Neural Systems**

Despite different substrates, compelling parallels exist between artificial and biological neural processing.

## Applicable Frameworks

### 1. Sparse Coding & Distributed Representations

**Biological Basis**: Neurons in V1 respond to specific oriented edges, forming sparse codes.

**Application to Transformers**:
- Attention heads as feature detectors
- Sparse activation patterns in MLPs
- Superposition as efficient coding

**Key Questions**:
- Do models discover similar efficient codes?
- How does sparsity emerge during training?
- What determines representation granularity?

### 2. Hierarchical Processing

**Biological Basis**: Visual cortex processes information hierarchically (V1→V2→V4→IT).

**Application to Transformers**:
- Early layers: Local features
- Middle layers: Compositional patterns
- Late layers: Abstract concepts

**Key Questions**:
- How strict is the hierarchy?
- Where do skip connections form?
- What determines layer specialization?

### 3. Predictive Coding

**Biological Basis**: Brain constantly predicts sensory input, updates on prediction error.

**Application to Transformers**:
- Residual connections carry predictions
- Attention updates based on surprisal
- MLPs refine predictions

**Key Questions**:
- Do models implement prediction error explicitly?
- How are priors encoded?
- Where are errors computed?

### 4. Binding Problem

**Biological Basis**: How does brain bind distributed features into unified percepts?

**Application to Transformers**:
- Token binding across positions
- Feature integration in attention
- Compositional representation assembly

**Key Questions**:
- How are distributed features bound?
- What mechanisms ensure coherent binding?
- When does binding fail?
