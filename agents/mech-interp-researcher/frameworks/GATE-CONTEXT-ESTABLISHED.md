# GATE: Framework Context Checkpoint

## ⚠️ MANDATORY CHECKPOINT - DO NOT PROCEED UNTIL FRAMEWORK SELECTED

**Purpose**: Ensure hypothesis is properly contextualized within theoretical frameworks before investigation design.

---

## Verification Checklist

**Framework Selection Complete:**

□ **Primary framework identified**: One main theoretical lens selected from frameworks/INDEX.md
□ **Framework fit justified**: Clear explanation why this framework applies
□ **Key concepts mapped**: Hypothesis components mapped to framework concepts
□ **Predictions refined**: Framework-specific predictions added

**Cross-Disciplinary Consideration:**

□ **Adjacent fields checked**: Reviewed frameworks/cross-disciplinary/ for patterns
□ **Analogies identified**: At least one cross-field parallel considered
□ **Unique aspects noted**: What makes this different from analogous phenomena

**Required Documentation:**

□ **Framework selection rationale** documented
□ **Mapping table** created: hypothesis components ↔ framework concepts
□ **Enhanced predictions** based on framework insights

## Required Artifacts from Phase 1

**Must reference:**
- ✓ Completed hypothesis template from Phase 1
- ✓ Mechanistic specificity verification passed
- ✓ GATE-SPECIFICITY-CHECK.md approved

**Cannot proceed without these artifacts from previous phase.**

## GATE STATUS

**IF ANY CHECKBOX UNCHECKED:**
- ❌ **BLOCKED** - Return to frameworks/INDEX.md
- Select appropriate theoretical framework
- Complete framework mapping
- Cannot design investigation without context

**IF ALL CHECKBOXES COMPLETE:**
- ✅ **GATE PASSED** - Proceed to investigations/WORKFLOW.md
- Framework context established
- Ready to design investigation

## Common Failures Requiring Return

**No Framework Selected:**
- ❌ "General investigation" → Select specific framework
- ❌ "Multiple frameworks equally apply" → Choose primary, note secondary
- ❌ "Framework unclear" → Return to INDEX, review options

**Poor Framework Fit:**
- ❌ Framework doesn't address mechanism → Find better match
- ❌ Forcing hypothesis into framework → Reconsider selection
- ❌ Framework too general → Select more specific approach

**Missing Cross-Connections:**
- ❌ No interdisciplinary check → Review cross-disciplinary/
- ❌ Ignoring obvious parallels → Document analogies
- ❌ Reinventing existing concepts → Check literature first

## Framework Selection Guide

**Strong Framework Match:**
- ✅ Natural concept mapping
- ✅ Framework predictions align with hypothesis
- ✅ Established methods available
- ✅ Clear evaluation criteria

**Weak Framework Match:**
- ⚠️ Forced terminology fitting
- ⚠️ Framework assumptions conflict
- ⚠️ Methods don't quite apply
- ⚠️ Evaluation criteria unclear
