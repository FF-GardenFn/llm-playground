**Hypothesis Type**: Emergent Capability or Phase Transition
**Use When**: Proposing capabilities that emerge at scale or through training

## Phenomenon Identification

**Emergent Capability**: [Specific capability, e.g., "Multi-hop reasoning"]

**Emergence Characteristics**:
- **Below threshold**: [Behavior absent or weak]
- **At threshold**: [Transition behavior]
- **Above threshold**: [Capability fully present]

**Scale Dependency**:
- Model size threshold: [Parameters, layers, heads]
- Data requirement: [Training examples needed]
- Compute requirement: [FLOPs or training steps]
- Architectural requirement: [Minimum components]

## Mechanistic Basis

**Pre-emergence Components**:

**Emergence Mechanism**:
- **Composition**: [How primitives combine]
- **Critical mass**: [What quantity enables emergence]
- **Phase transition**: [Sharp vs gradual emergence]
- **Catalyzing factor**: [What triggers the emergence]

## Observable Transitions

**Behavioral Markers**:

## Critical Factors

**Necessary Conditions**:
- [ ] Minimum model capacity: [Specific requirement]

## Testable Predictions

**Scaling Experiments**:
- Below [X] parameters: [Expected behavior]
- At [X-Y] parameters: [Transition zone]
- Above [Y] parameters: [Emerged capability]

**Controlled Emergence**:

- Partial emergence: [How to achieve]

**Cross-Model Predictions**:
- Architecture A: [Emergence point]
- Architecture B: [Different emergence point]
- Transfer learning: [Effect on emergence]

## Phase Transition Analysis

**Order of Transition**:
- [ ] First-order (discontinuous jump)
- [ ] Second-order (continuous but sharp)
- [ ] Higher-order (complex transition)

**Critical Exponents** (if applicable):
- Scaling relationship: [Mathematical form]
- Power law: [Exponent value]
- Universality class: [If identified]

**Hysteresis Effects**:
- Forward transition: [Conditions]
- Reverse transition: [Different conditions?]
- Bistability region: [Where both states possible]

---

## Mechanistic Precursors

**Early Indicators** (before full emergence):
- Precursor 1: [Detectable before capability]
- Precursor 2: [Warning sign of emergence]
- Precursor 3: [Partial capability marker]

**Component Evolution**:
1. Stage 1: [Component state/function]
2. Stage 2: [Intermediate development]
3. Stage 3: [Near-emergence state]
4. Stage 4: [Post-emergence specialization]

---

## Distinguishing from Alternatives

**Not Simply Memorization Because**:
- [Specific evidence against memorization]
- [Generalization beyond training data]

**Not Gradual Improvement Because**:
- [Sharp transition evidence]
- [Qualitative change, not quantitative]

**Requires Emergence Because**:
- [Cannot be achieved by scaling alone]
- [Involves reorganization, not just growth]

---

## Falsification Criteria

**This hypothesis is FALSE if**:
- [ ] Capability present in smaller models
- [ ] Gradual improvement without transition
- [ ] Same capability via different mechanism
- [ ] Threshold predictions incorrect
- [ ] Precursors absent before emergence

**Critical experiments**:
1. [Experiment to test threshold]
2. [Experiment to test mechanism]
3. [Experiment to test necessity]
