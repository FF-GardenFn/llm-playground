# Research Investigation Framework

## Investigation Phases

Research flows through natural phases:
1. **Hypothesis Reception** - Formalize claims with mechanistic specificity
2. **Framework Context** - Connect to theoretical foundations
3. **Investigation Design** - Plan causal interventions and controls
4. **Implication Exploration** - Trace consequences and generate questions
5. **Iteration** - Refine based on evidence

Each phase navigates to relevant knowledge.

---

## Hypothesis Reception

Formalize claims using structured templates:

**Select hypothesis type:**

- **Causal mechanism**: Component X causes effect Y via mechanism Z
  - Template: hypotheses/templates/causal-claim.md
  - Example: "Attention head 5.1 performs error correction via residual path inhibition"

- **Circuit algorithm**: Heads H implement algorithm A using matrices M
  - Template: hypotheses/templates/circuit-hypothesis.md
  - Example: "Induction heads (L0.H7 → L1.H4) implement in-context learning via QK copying"

- **Training emergence**: Phenomenon P emerges at phase T
  - Template: hypotheses/templates/emergence-hypothesis.md
  - Example: "Superposition develops during phase transition at 40% training"

**Formalization guide:** hypotheses/FORMALIZATION.md

**Mechanistic specificity checks:**
- Does it name specific components? (layers, heads, neurons)
- Does it describe mechanism? (not just correlation)
- Does it predict interventions? (what happens if we ablate/patch)
- Is it falsifiable? (what evidence would disprove it)

---

## Framework Context

Match hypothesis to theoretical frameworks:

**Core mech-interp frameworks:**
- **Superposition & polysemanticity** → frameworks/superposition.md
  - When: Features, sparsity, dictionary learning, SAEs
  - Concepts: Toy models, interference, sparse coding

- **Circuit composition & analysis** → frameworks/circuits.md
  - When: Attention patterns, information flow, algorithmic structure
  - Concepts: OV/QK matrices, path analysis, composition

- **Training dynamics & emergence** → frameworks/training-dynamics.md
  - When: Learning phases, sudden capabilities, grokking
  - Concepts: Phase transitions, loss landscapes, optimization

**Framework selection guide:** frameworks/INDEX.md

**Cross-disciplinary parallels:**
- Neuroscience connections → frameworks/cross-disciplinary/neuroscience.md
  - Sparse coding, predictive coding, hierarchical processing

- Physics analogies → frameworks/cross-disciplinary/physics.md
  - Phase transitions, criticality, statistical mechanics

- Philosophy of mind → frameworks/cross-disciplinary/philosophy.md
  - Functionalism, emergence vs reduction, multiple realizability

---

## Investigation Design

Standard investigation pattern: investigations/WORKFLOW.md

**Core workflow components:**
1. **Decomposition** - Break hypothesis into atomic testable claims
2. **Alternative mechanisms** - Generate 3-4 competing explanations
3. **Differential predictions** - How do mechanisms differ observably
4. **Critical experiments** - Design tests that discriminate
5. **Controls** - Rule out confounds and validate assumptions

**Example investigations:**
- Attention-based error correction → investigations/examples/attention-error-correction.md
- Induction head discovery → investigations/examples/induction-heads.md
- Superposition detection → investigations/examples/superposition-detection.md

**Validation patterns:**
- Quick sanity checks → investigations/validation/sanity-checks.md
- Robustness testing → investigations/validation/robustness-tests.md

**Key principle:** Generate competing explanations. Single hypothesis is not science.

## Tool Selection

## Implication Exploration

For validated findings, systematically trace consequences:

**Immediate implications:**
- What does this directly explain?
- What phenomena become interpretable?
- What predictions does this enable?

**Cascade effects:**
- What else might this mechanism affect?
- How does this change related hypotheses?
- What boundary conditions exist?

**Theoretical consequences:**
- How do existing frameworks adapt?
- What new theoretical questions emerge?
- What cross-field connections appear?

**Practical applications:**
- How could this inform training?
- What safety/alignment implications?
- What new research directions open?

**New mysteries:**
- What does this fail to explain?
- What unexpected phenomena appear?
- What deeper questions arise?

---

## Iteration & Synthesis

Document findings and evolve investigation:

**Update hypothesis:**
- Which claims validated?
- Which falsified?
- What refinements needed?

**Record negative results:**
- What approaches failed?
- Why did they fail?
- What does failure constrain?

**Identify boundaries:**
- Where does mechanism apply?
- Where does it break?
- What are edge cases?

**Generate next experiments:**
- What remains untested?
- What new questions emerged?
- What deeper investigation needed?

## Cross-Disciplinary Integration

Actively seek parallels across fields:

**Neuroscience** (frameworks/cross-disciplinary/neuroscience.md):
- Sparse coding in V1 → Superposition in transformers
- Predictive coding → Error correction mechanisms
- Binding problem → Feature composition

**Physics** (frameworks/cross-disciplinary/physics.md):
- Phase transitions → Training dynamics
- Criticality → Edge of chaos in networks
- Statistical mechanics → Ensemble properties

**Mathematics**:
- Category theory → Compositional structure
- Dynamical systems → Training trajectories
- Information theory → Compression and encoding

**Philosophy** (frameworks/cross-disciplinary/philosophy.md):
- Functionalism → Implementation independence
- Emergence → Macro properties from micro rules
- Multiple realizability → Different circuits, same function

**When to use:** Always. Cross-field thinking generates novel hypotheses and validates mechanisms.

## Literature Integration

Search strategy: literature/SEARCH-STRATEGY.md

**Key paper categories:**
- **Foundational work** → literature/key-papers/foundational.md
  - Toy models, circuits zoom-in, interpretability frameworks

- **Recent developments** → literature/key-papers/recent-developments.md
  - SAEs, dictionary learning, mechanistic anomaly detection

- **Cross-field connections** → literature/key-papers/cross-field.md
  - Neuroscience parallels, physics analogies, theoretical foundations

**Integration pattern:**
1. Find relevant papers (search strategy)
2. Extract applicable frameworks
3. Adapt methods to current investigation
4. Note conflicts or synergies with hypothesis
5. Incorporate findings into theoretical context

## Research Standards

**Mechanistic specificity required:**
- Name components (layers, heads, circuits)
- Describe mechanisms (not correlations)
- Predict interventions (causal claims)
- Show falsifiability (what would disprove)

**Competing explanations required:**
- Generate 3-4 alternative mechanisms
- Design experiments that discriminate
- Update based on evidence

**Cross-disciplinary thinking encouraged:**
- Seek parallels in other fields
- Import theoretical frameworks
- Export findings to related domains

**Negative results valuable:**
- Failed approaches constrain theory space
- Document what doesn't work
- Update understanding based on failures
