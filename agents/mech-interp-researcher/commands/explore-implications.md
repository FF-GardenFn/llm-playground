# Explore Implications Command

Execute Phase 4 research: systematically trace consequences of validated findings, identify boundary conditions, generate new questions.

## What this does

1. **Traces immediate implications** (what does this directly explain?)
2. **Identifies cascade effects** (what else might this affect?)
3. **Explores theoretical consequences** (how do frameworks adapt?)
4. **Discovers practical applications** (training, safety, alignment)
5. **Generates new mysteries** (what does this fail to explain?)

## Usage

```bash
# Explore implications of validated finding
/explore-implications

# Focus on specific implication category
/explore-implications --focus theoretical  # Theoretical consequences
/explore-implications --focus practical    # Applications
/explore-implications --focus mysteries    # New questions

# Generate research roadmap
/explore-implications --roadmap
```

## Your Task

1. **Load validated finding**: Review experimental results
2. **Trace immediate implications**: What phenomena become interpretable?
3. **Identify cascade effects**: What related hypotheses change?
4. **Explore theoretical consequences**: How do frameworks adapt?
5. **Discover practical applications**: Training, safety, alignment
6. **Generate new mysteries**: What remains unexplained?
7. **Complete gate**: `implications/GATE-IMPLICATIONS-TRACED.md`
8. **Report**: Multi-level implications with new research questions

## Expected Output

```
✓ Implications explored

Validated finding:
"Attention head 5.1 corrects errors via residual path inhibition (Mechanism A confirmed)"

Experimental evidence:
- Ablation increases error rate 23% (p < 0.001)
- Residual stream contribution is negative (-0.42 average)
- OV matrix projects inhibitory signal onto incorrect tokens
- Effect robust across error types and datasets

Immediate implications:

What this directly explains:
✓ Why ablating L5.H1 degrades performance
✓ How transformer self-corrects next-token errors
✓ Why attention heads can have negative residual contributions
✓ How error correction emerges without explicit supervision

What phenomena become interpretable:
- Improved accuracy on low-probability tokens → L5.H1 suppresses high-prob errors
- Robustness to prompt typos → L5.H1 corrects contextual inconsistencies
- Better factual recall → L5.H1 inhibits memorized-but-wrong associations

Cascade effects:

What else might this mechanism affect:
1. Other error-correction circuits: Are there similar heads in other layers?
2. Composition with downstream heads: Do later heads rely on L5.H1's corrections?
3. Training dynamics: When does L5.H1 develop this capability?
4. Superposition: Does L5.H1 implement multiple correction types?

How this changes related hypotheses:
- **Hypothesis**: "Layer 5 refines representations" → REFINED: "L5.H1 specifically inhibits errors"
- **Hypothesis**: "Attention is only additive" → FALSIFIED: Residual can be inhibitory
- **Hypothesis**: "Error correction requires feedback" → CHALLENGED: Feedforward sufficient

Boundary conditions:
- L5.H1 corrects errors in contexts with ≥ 5 tokens
- Effect diminishes for errors in first 2 tokens
- Strongest for semantic errors, weaker for syntax
- Not effective for out-of-distribution inputs

Theoretical consequences:

How existing frameworks adapt:
- **Circuit framework**: Add "inhibitory attention" pattern category
- **Superposition framework**: Negative features = inhibitory signals
- **Training dynamics**: Error correction emerges in mid-training (hypothesis)

What new theoretical questions emerge:
1. How common are inhibitory attention patterns?
2. Do inhibitory heads always use residual path?
3. What training signal produces inhibitory circuits?
4. Is there a general "error correction architecture"?

Cross-field connections:
- **Neuroscience**: Lateral inhibition in cortex → inhibitory attention in transformers
- **Control theory**: Negative feedback loops → residual inhibition
- **Sparse coding**: Inhibitory connections reduce interference → same in transformers?

Practical applications:

Training implications:
- Could we train models to develop more inhibitory heads?
- Would explicit error-correction loss accelerate emergence?
- Can we initialize weights to encourage inhibitory patterns?

Safety/alignment implications:
- Inhibitory heads might prevent confident wrong answers
- Could amplify L5.H1 to reduce hallucinations
- Error correction = self-monitoring = partial alignment?

New research directions:
1. Survey all heads for inhibitory patterns
2. Ablate multiple inhibitory heads simultaneously
3. Train model with error-correction auxiliary loss
4. Apply to other architectures (LSTMs, CNNs)

New mysteries:

What this fails to explain:
- Why L5.H1 specifically? (Not L4 or L6)
- How does L5.H1 "know" which tokens are errors?
- What upstream heads provide error signal to L5.H1?
- Why negative residual (why not zero-out attention)?

What unexpected phenomena appeared:
- L5.H1 sometimes over-corrects (suppresses correct tokens)
- Effect stronger on GPT-2 than GPT-3 (why?)
- Ablating L5.H1 improves performance on adversarial prompts (!)

What deeper questions arise:
1. Is error correction a general transformer capability or model-specific?
2. Do humans have analogous inhibitory attention mechanisms?
3. Could we design architectures with explicit error-correction modules?
4. What is the relationship between error correction and robustness?

Follow-up experiments:
[ ] Survey all 144 heads in GPT-2 for inhibitory patterns
[ ] Track L5.H1 development during training (when does it emerge?)
[ ] Test generalization: Does L5.H1 correct errors in other domains?
[ ] Investigate over-correction cases: When does inhibition go wrong?
[ ] Design intervention: Can we steer L5.H1 to reduce hallucinations?
